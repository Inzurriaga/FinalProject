## Mountains
### Skill Distillery Final Project

Mountains was a full stack application that allows user who love hiking and climbing to create and join events for their passion. When first going to the site users can create an account and right away look for events and also create events. When they click on a event users will notice a 3D mountain. The mountains are generated by using the data from MapBox API. When user join the event they can join the event chatroom. User not only can join an event but create one. When creating an event user provide the mountain info and with the information they provided we can generate a mountain from anywhere in the world.
